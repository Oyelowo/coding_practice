/*
The +1 business here is a bit subtle: the A..B notation specifies a range that’s inclusive at the beginning but exclusive at the end. For example 1..5 represents numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 but not 5.

So to go through all the values between x1 and x2 (including both), we’d have to write x1..(x2 + 1). But we want to make sure each room is enclosed in a wall, so we want to go from x1 to x2 exclusive. To do that, we add 1 to the first coordinate and subtract one from the second, ending up with (x1 + 1)..x2. If x1 is 1 and x2 is 5, we would put empty tiles at positions 2, 3 and 4 and leave 1 and 5 solid.

    There’s a ton of different ways to create the map. One common alternative is one continuous Vec with MAP_HEIGHT * MAP_WIDTH items. To access a tile on (x, y), you would do map[y * MAP_WIDTH + x]. The advantage is that you only do one array lookup instead of two and iterating over every object in the map is faster because they’re all in the same region of memory.
Or you could treat walls and everything else in the map as just another Object and store them there. This would make the game structure simpler (everything is an Object) and more flexible (just add HP to make a wall destructible, or damage to one that’s supposed to be covered with spikes).
