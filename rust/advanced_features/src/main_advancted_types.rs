// To work with DSTs, Rust has a particular trait called the Sized trait to determine whether or not a typeâ€™s size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented for everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust implicitly adds a bound on Sized to every generic function. That is, a generic function definition like this:

fn generic<T>(t: T) -> T {
    // --snip--
    t
}
// is actually treated as though we had written this:

/* fn generic<T: Sized>(t: T) {
    // --snip--
} */

// By default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known size at compile time. However, you can use the following special syntax to relax this restriction:

fn generic2<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) -> &T {
    t
}
