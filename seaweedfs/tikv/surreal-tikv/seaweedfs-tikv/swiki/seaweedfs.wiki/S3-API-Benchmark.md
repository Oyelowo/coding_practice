# Test setup

Here are some tests on one single computer. However, if you need more performance, you can add `filer` and `s3` to linearly increase total throughput.

# Test with Warp
https://github.com/minio/warp

Warp is a more complete test suite. It needs identity access management. So you would need to configure authentication info with `weed s3 -conf=...` or `weed filer -s3 -s3.conf=...`. See https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Amazon-S3-API#authentication

Here is the results from my local laptop written to an external SSD via USB 3.1:

```

# Another test with warp

Here is a user-provided `run-warp.sh` file.
```
#!/bin/bash -e

if [[ "$#" -lt 1 ]]
then
  echo "Usage: $0 count [options]"
  exit 1
fi

COUNT="$1"
shift

COUNTER=0
while [  $COUNTER -lt $COUNT ]; do
    let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
    warp client "127.0.0.1:576${COUNTER}" \
      1> warp-client-"${COUNTER}".out \
      2> warp-client-"${COUNTER}".err &
done

sleep 5

warp "$@" \
  --host "localhost:8333" \
  --access-key "some_access_key1" --secret-key "some_secret_key1" \
  --bucket warp-"${COUNTER}-$(date +%s)" \
  --warp-client=127.0.0.1:576{1...$COUNT} \
  1> warp.out \
  2> warp.err

```

Start the warp this way:
```
./run-warp.sh 4 list --concurrent 5 --objects 100000 --obj.size=4KiB --duration 60s
```

Here is the result:
```

# Test with Hotsauce S3 Benchmark
Found this https://github.com/markhpc/hsbench tool which seems easy to use.
