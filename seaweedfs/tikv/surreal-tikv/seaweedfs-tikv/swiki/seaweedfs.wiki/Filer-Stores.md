### Comparing Storage Options

The Filer Store persists all file metadata and directory information.

| Filer Store Name | Lookup | number of entries in a folder | Scalability | Directory Renaming | TTL | [Fast Bucket Deletion](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/S3-API-FAQ#how-to-speed-up-bucket-deletion) |Note |
| ---------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| memory       | O(1)   | limited by memory | Local, Fast                | | Yes| | for testing only, no persistent storage |
| leveldb      | O(logN)| unlimited | Local, Very Fast               | | Yes| | Default, fairly scalable |
| leveldb2     | O(logN)| unlimited | Local, Very Fast               | | Yes| | Similar to leveldb, part of the lookup key is 128bit MD5 instead of the long full file path |
| leveldb3     | O(logN)| unlimited | Local, Very Fast               | | Yes| Yes| Similar to leveldb2, separate leveldb instance for each bucket |
| RocksDB      | O(logN)| unlimited | Local, Very Fast               | | Native| | Default, fairly scalable. Need to manually build. |
| Sqlite       | O(logN)| unlimited | Local, Very Fast               |Atomic| Yes | Yes | Default, fairly scalable, Stream backup. Need to manually build. |
| Mongodb      | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast     | | Yes| | Easy to manage |
| Arangodb     | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast     | | Native| Yes | Easy to manage; Scalable |
| YDB          | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Native| Yes | Easy to manage; True elastic Scalability; High Availability. Need to manually build. |
| [Redis2](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Filer-Redis-Setup)| O(1)   | limited   | Local or Distributed, Fastest  ||Native| | one directory's children are stored in one key~value entry |
| [Redis3](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Filer-Redis-Setup)| O(1)   | unlimited   | Local or Distributed, Fastest  ||Native| | one directory's children are spread into multiple key~value entries |
| Cassandra    | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Very Fast||Native| |                |
| MySql        | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| | Easy to manage |

| Postgres     | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| | Easy to manage |
| Postgres2    | O(logN)| unlimited | Local or Distributed, Fast    |Atomic| Yes| Yes| Easy to manage |
| MemSql       | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| Yes| Scalable |
| TiDB         | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| Yes| Scalable |
| CockroachDB  | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| Yes| Scalable |
| YugabyteDB   | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     |Atomic| Yes| Yes| Scalable |
| Etcd         | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, 10,000 writes/sec     || Yes| | No SPOF. High Availability. Limited Capacity.|
| ElasticSearch| O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     || Yes| | Scalable, Searchable. Need to manually build. |
| HBase        | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     | | Native| | Scalable |
| TiKV         | O(logN)| unlimited | Distributed, Fast     |Atomic|Yes| Yes| Scalable. High Availability. Need to manually build. |

#### Switching between different Stores
It is easy to switch between different filer stores.

For example:
```sh

# first save current filer meta data

$ weed shell
> fs.cd /
> fs.meta.save
...
total 65 directories, 292 files
meta data for http://localhost:8888/ is saved to localhost-8888-20190417-005421.meta
> exit

# now switch to a new filer, and load the previously saved metadata
$ weed shell
> fs.meta.load localhost-8888-20190417-005421.meta
...
total 65 directories, 292 files
localhost-8888-20190417-005421.meta is loaded to http://localhost:8888/

```

### Extending Storage Options

For any new storage option, please implement the FilerStore interface. It should be fairly straight forward to implement. Welcome to contribute back.
