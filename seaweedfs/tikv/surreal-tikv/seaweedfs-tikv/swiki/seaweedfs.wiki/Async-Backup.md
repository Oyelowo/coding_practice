Cloud storage options, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Backblaze B2, etc, are ideal for backup purpose.

For example, for Amazon S3, the upload is free. You only pay for the storage.
So you have the benefit of:
* Extremely fast access to local SeaweedFS Filer
* Near-Real-Time Backup to Amazon S3 with zero-cost upload network traffic.

Of course, you can also backup to local disks on another machine.

# Architecture

![SeaweedFS Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/master/note/SeaweedFS_Filer_Backup.png)


All file meta data changes in Filer are saved in the logs and can be subscribed. See [[Filer Change Data Capture]].
A "weed filer.backup" process will subscribe to this topic, and then read the actual file content, and send the update to the cloud sink or local disk sinks.

* Sinks can be: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, Backblaze B2, or Local Disk.


# Configuration

This command replaced the previous `weed filer.replicate`, which requires an external message queue.
But for configuration, use the same `weed scaffold -config=replication` to generate a `replication.toml` file. Just need to keep the lines of the sinks that you want to use.

```
[sink.s3]
# read credentials doc at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/sessions.html
# default loads credentials from the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials).
enabled = false
aws_access_key_id     = ""     # if empty, loads from the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials).
aws_secret_access_key = ""     # if empty, loads from the shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials).
region = "us-east-2"
bucket = "backupbucket"        # an existing bucket
directory = "/"                # destination directory
endpoint = "http://localhost:8334"
is_incremental = false

```

# Running Backup
1. Make sure the `replication.toml` is in place.
1. Start the backup by running `weed filer.backup`.

Unless interrupted, the `weed filer.backup` will run continuously and keep retrying if any error happens. 

The `weed filer.backup` process can also be stopped at any time. The current backup progress, which is the "offset" for normal message queues, is stored on filer with the key as `<sink_name, sink_folder>`. So to resume, you can just restart, or even start from another server, as long as you have the same `replication.toml` file

# Backup Strategies

There are 2 backup strategies supported as of now:
1. Continuously mirrored changes. All the content are stored with the same directory structure as the source, but in a remote machine or a cloud vendor.
2. Differential Incremental mode. New or updated content are stored in its folder named as modified date. Deletions are not applied.

## Incremental Mode
If `is_incremental = true`, all the files are backed up under the `YYYY-MM-DD` directories, which the timestamps are based on modified time.
So 
* Each date directory contains all new and updated files. 
* The deleted files in the source filer will not be deleted on the backup.

So if in this folder, on `2021-03-01`, these files are created in the source:
```
  /dir1/file1
  /dir1/file2
  /dir1/file3
```
and on `2021-03-02`, these files are created, modified, deleted in the source:
```
  /dir1/file1 // modified
  /dir1/file2 // not changed
  /dir1/file3 // deleted
  /dir1/file4 // created
```

The backup destination will have the following directory structure.
```
  /2021-03-01/dir1/file1
  /2021-03-01/dir1/file2
  /2021-03-01/dir1/file3
  /2021-03-02/dir1/file1
  /2021-03-02/dir1/file4
```
