/* 
Fallback
Level completed!
Difficulty 1/10

Look carefully at the contract's code below.

You will beat this level if

you claim ownership of the contract
you reduce its balance to 0
  Things that might help

How to send ether when interacting with an ABI
How to send ether outside of the ABI
Converting to and from wei/ether units (see help() command)
Fallback methods
You know the basics of how ether goes in and out of contracts, including the usage of the fallback method.

You've also learnt about OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract, and how it can be used to restrict the usage of some methods to a privileged address.

Move on to the next level when you're ready!



SOLUTION:
// Send less than 0.001 ether to the contract
- await contract.contribute.sendTransaction({value: 0.00009});

// This calls the receive function when no value passed
- await contract.sendTransaction({value: 1});
