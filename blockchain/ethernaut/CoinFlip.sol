/* 
Info

Level completed!
Difficulty 3/10

This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

  Things that might help

See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"
Generating random numbers in solidity can be tricky. There currently isn't a native way to generate them, and everything you use in smart contracts is publicly visible, including the local variables and state variables marked as private. Miners also have control over things like blockhashes, timestamps, and whether to include certain transactions - which allows them to bias these values in their favor.

To get cryptographically proven random numbers, you can use Chainlink VRF, which uses an oracle, the LINK token, and an on-chain contract to verify that the number is truly random.

Some other options include using Bitcoin block headers (verified through BTC Relay), RANDAO, or Oraclize).

/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
